# thumbsdb-youtube-scraper

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/gerbilsinspace/thumbsdb-youtube-scraper.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a small script that scrapes all the youtube videos uploaded by IdleVideos, and outputs into json for data collection purposes.

Although I am much happier with the code now I've revisited it, it is quite bespoke and I'd like to use this code for other youtubers.

## Prerequisites.

You will need to have nodejs and casper installed on your computer.

## Installation.

- Download the code. 
- in your command line, go to the root folder, and run npm install.
- make sure to have casperjs and phantomjs installed globally. If you are on a mac, look into using brew for the install process.

## Run
- run in the command line, casperjs scraper.js. the results should be in the results folder.
